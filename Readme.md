## Todo List

- A text box at the top to add a todo items to the list
- Add button: When a user clicks on the button, add that todo items to the list
- A delete button to delete the todo item completely form the list
- A checkbox to check the item off the list ( Checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items).
- Total Number of tasks in the list
- Extra points for creativity (think about user accessibility, some animations and things like that)
